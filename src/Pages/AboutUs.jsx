          <p>Welcome to SchwetzDeitsch.org This website is a labor of love, and a gift to my community. The goal of this site is to become a much needed resource for learning Dutch, ie Pennsylvania Dutch, ie Deitsch.</p>
          <p>This website is a companion tool that is best used in conjunction with as many resources you can get for learning Dutch. I will add as much to the website as I can but in general there are better explinations of grammar and definitions available in print and on the internet than you will find here.</p> 
          <p>This site will be most helpful for practicing, refershing, expanding, and solidifying the concepts you are also learning elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>How to use this site</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            To start you can click on the practice button in the navigation bar.
            There you will find a list of flashcard decks that I have made.
            When you click on a deck it will highlight.
            Click on the decks that you want to practice and click start.
            You will then be presented with a prompt side of a flash card.
            When you are ready you can click flip and you will see the answer side of the flash card.
            You can then score yourself and a new card will appear.
            Behind the scenes the score increases or decreases the rate that the same card will reappear.
            The game goes on indefinitly.
            You can restart and pick new decks anytime you want, and come back for quick practices with no time commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some cards have different formats.
            The basic card has English on the front and Dutch on the back.
            Cards may also have images and audio to aid in learning.
            I often include a text box for you to write your response, and I encorage you to speak your response aswell.
            Please keep in mind that these decks are a tool that you can use however you find helpful.
            Some cards will have a text box for you to write down your answer, to help with writting and to better compare with the answer.
            But you don't have to use the textbox, respond outloud or in your head if you want.
            My goal is to give you tools that you can use, feel free to ignore any element that isn't working for you.

            A unique part of this language learning system is the self grading. 
            You wont be judged here, by a robot or a teacher.
            The idea is to remove embarrassment and barriers to practice and putting yourself out there.
            After a card is finished you can decide for youself if you need to see that card more friquently or less friquently.
            You also get to decide if you remebered correctly or pronounced close enough etc.
            Also in language learning there is rarely if ever only one correct answer.
            Some cards may ask you a question.
            The answer side of the card will show you the answer I intended. 
            I have attempted to verify the grammar for the Dutch on the site.
            But if you feel your answer was different but also correct then give yourself a green check and keep going!
            </p>

              As I build the website I plan on writting companion lessons that you can review as needed.
              I also plan on adding explinations for words and phrases and sentences in the dictionary page.
              The dictionary page isn't intended to be complete dictionary, atleast that's not the plan today.
              Instead the dictionary is intended to be a resource for only the words that actually appear in the site.
              Ideally cards will have links to pages in the dictionary section of the site.
              That way you can read more explinations of the grammer or translations or definitions of a word or phrase.

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            This website is made only by me. 
            Guder Daag! I'm Derek. I am a computer programmer, and I'm Fancy Dutch. 
            A common story for many of the Fancy Dutch is that in the late 1800s or early 1900s the language was not passed down to the next generation; 
            during periods of intense ethnic and linguistic based abuse in the united states.
            That is the case for my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this website primarily for myself, my husband, and my family.
            Publishing the website was actually the easiest way for me to create a portable language learning tool for us.
            Because I am also using this website I am also the text subject.
            I am going to learn Dutch.
            I am very passinate about it.
            And I am going to collect what I learn here.
            If a strategy is working I'll add more of it, and if it is failing then I will switch gears to other strategies.
            Also my husband has a very differen't learning style than me so by making the website work well for both of us then maybe it will work well for you.
